00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,324
THE DREAM PLACE

3
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,118
FOR START-UPS

4
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,788
ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS
FOR SAND BOX'S 12TH RESIDENCY PROGRAM

5
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,834
A PLACE WHERE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE

6
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,171
A PLACE WHERE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE

7
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,674
I WANT TO LAUNCH MY START-UP BECAUSE

8
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,971
I WANT TO BE AN INSPIRING CEO

9
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,432
I WANT TO TAKE…

10
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,358
<i>Even when you think your code is complete…</i>

11
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,029
I DON'T WANT TO…

12
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,158
<i>…one missing conditional can create a bug</i>

13
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>and crash your program.</i>

14
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,080
BUG: AN ERROR IN THE SOURCE CODE

15
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,794
I WANT TO TURN…

16
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,386
<i>There was one conditional in particular,</i>

17
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,848
<i>"If Sand Box is everyone's dream…"</i>

18
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,561
APPLICATION FOR THE 12TH
SAND BOX RESIDENCY PROGRAM

19
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,328
WON IN-JAE, NAM DO-SAN, SEO DAL-MI

20
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,582
<i>I overlooked this one conditional</i>

21
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,375
<i>and this is</i>

22
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,380
<i>the result of it.</i>

23
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,757
Who do you choose,

24
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,051
me or Seo Dal-mi?

25
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,483
Do-san.

26
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,157
<i>A bug occurred, and I crashed.</i>

27
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,745
1. PLAYGROUND FILLED WITH SAND
TO PREVENT INJURIES

28
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,829
2. TEST ENVIRONMENT FOR DEVELOPERS

29
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,123
3. POSTPONEMENT OF REGULATIONS
FOR THE RELEASE OF NEW PRODUCTS

30
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,897
Dal-mi, wipe the drool
and sleep in your bed.

31
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,651
-Grandma, I have a business idea.
-Yes?

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,654
A restaurant you can start with no money.

33
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,865
Restaurants that only have kitchens,
in one place.

34
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,992
A restaurant needs more than a kitchen.

35
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,078
Where will the customers sit?

36
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,830
They won't.

37
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,165
It'll be delivery-only.

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,167
No interior design,

39
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,002
and no tables or chairs.

40
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,254
Just a kitchen.

41
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,839
Since you don't need much capital,

42
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,175
it's no big deal even if you fail.

43
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,971
Mother, listen to this.

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,725
-What?
-A website that displays all the leaflets.

45
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,686
Instead of looking at leaflets,

46
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,938
you go to the website

47
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,191
and browse all the delivery restaurants
by category.

48
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,612
Dad, how about introducing
a ranking system?

49
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,532
There will be five different classes.

50
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,035
-That sounds great.
-Dal-mi, that's a brilliant idea.

51
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,957
We'll let the customers
review the restaurants.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,875
If the ratings are high…

53
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,770
Dad.

54
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,898
What do we do now?

55
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,402
What?

56
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,238
It's okay.

57
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,241
It's no big deal.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,001
Don't worry too much. It's okay.

59
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,675
Simply put, it's like a coworking space,
but it's for restaurants.

60
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,263
Not interesting? Okay, let's move on.

61
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,514
Grandma.

62
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,268
How about cars that don't need keys?

63
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,479
Instead, we can use
biometrics authentication.

64
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,274
With fingerprint scanners, you won't
have to carry around your car keys.

65
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,110
No, wait.

66
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,155
Facial recognition would be better.

67
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,657
It's a hassle to take off your gloves
when it's cold.

68
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,368
-Dal-mi.
-Yes?

69
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,581
Running a business

70
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,793
is hard. You know that, right?

71
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,879
Of course.

72
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,218
But it's not as hard as before.

73
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,512
Even high schoolers
start businesses these days.

74
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,973
Also, I might have found a way.

75
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,683
What way?

76
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,268
It's a secret.

77
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,270
I'll tell you if I get in.

78
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,856
Just tell me now.

79
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,609
I don't want to.
It'll be embarrassing if I don't get in.

80
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,237
Facial recognition, not fingerprints.

81
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,990
My gosh. Unbelievable.

82
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,454
Good morning.

83
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,414
Hi.

84
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,126
Let's start the meeting.
Where are the others?

85
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:05,633
Gosh. I am totally against the flexible
working hour idea. I think it's stupid.

86
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,510
Please come to meetings on time.

87
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,429
Tell the ones that are not here yet
to come right now.

88
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,140
Let's get started.

89
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,976
The thing is… Here, sir.

90
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,771
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

91
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,440
What are these?

92
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,609
I'm sorry to say this
when you trusted and followed me.

93
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,612
But I might not be able to pay you
for the time being.

94
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,614
We also won't get an office anytime soon.

95
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,161
I like it. It feels like we're making
a fresh start.

96
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,997
Not many offices
come with Jacuzzis, do they?

97
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,085
-You're right.
-That aroma oil does wonders.

98
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,504
All my wrinkles and spots are gone.

99
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,798
Your eyes are aging,
so you don't see them.

100
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,757
They're not gone.

101
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,758
You…

102
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,595
Who are these people?

103
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,598
If you don't see the spots on your face,
get glasses.

104
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,893
Wait. Should she consider it a blessing
and do nothing?

105
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,904
Don't tell me you're using
my hotel room as your office.

106
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,865
I am. Please bear with me
until I get into Sand Box.

107
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,911
There, I can rent an office for free
and pay my employees.

108
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,288
Sorry to interrupt your meeting.

109
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,998
We need to talk.

110
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,966
Sand Box? Why would you get in there?

111
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,969
Isn't that a place for people
with no money or connections?

112
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,221
Exactly.

113
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,307
I need to succeed
with no money or connections.

114
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,893
Why? You have money and connections.

115
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,102
I'm not divorced yet.

116
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,607
Is that why you're putting up with this?
To give me money and connections?

117
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,818
Didn't you thank me for giving you
a rich dad?

118
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,070
I am thankful.

119
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,989
As long as I have a rich dad,
I can't take any credit.

120
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,950
I'm not even acknowledged by my own mom.

121
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,701
I learned that thanks to you.

122
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,911
Are you serious?

123
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,081
You think it's easy
to start a business from zero?

124
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,544
Are you doing this to make me worry?

125
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,586
"Worry"?

126
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,552
Why is it so infuriating
to hear you say you worry about me?

127
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,055
Do you worry about one
and encourage the other?

128
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,433
Bluffing without a real plan
makes you a fraud.

129
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,728
Sorting things out afterward
makes you the same as your father.

130
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm rooting for you.

131
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,658
In-jae, I just--

132
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,159
If you acknowledge me,

133
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,205
don't worry about me. Just encourage me.

00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,980
I grabbed it first.

137
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,609
Too bad. I grabbed it before you did.

138
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,572
Why would a lawyer apply for Sand Box?

139
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,034
Law is just a hobby. I'm a designer.

140
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,702
Why are you applying, then?

141
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,122
Because I have nothing. No connections,
no credentials, and no money.

142

-It's Seo Dal-mi.

143
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,793
-Why?
-To steer clear of you.

144
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,962
I have nothing to gain from you.

145
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
What's your name?

146
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,134
It's Jung Sa-ha. Why?

147
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,887
I have a lot to gain
from someone competent like you.

148
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,183
You want to leech off me
but can't give up the book for me?

149
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,365
I'll give you 1,000 won.
Give up the book for me.

150
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,368
I'll give you 5,000.

151
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,704
Deal.

152
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,792
Give up so easily?

153
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,091

Oh, they have them here.

Excuse me.

where you found that book?

<i>when a girl calls you darling?</i>

-I mean the girl from earlier.

Oh, my. I can't believe this.

179
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,838
Was she hitting on us, Do-san?

180
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,089
What?

181
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,144
Give me that.

182
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,187
Here.

183
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,148
Goodness.

184
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,693
<i>JOINING SAND BOX Q AND A</i>

185
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,908
-I dropped my earring.
-Me, too. No, I mean…

186
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,619
-Hello.
-Hello.

187
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,205
-Why are you here?
-I'm getting a book about San--

188
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,665
San Francisco. About Silicon Valley.

189
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,710
That's right.
Our company is going global soon.

190
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,505
Already going global? That's impressive.

191
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,883
No, there's nothing impressive about us.

192
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,427
Isn't he so humble?

193
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,359
Where's your car?

194
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,485
My car?

195
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,112
I slept over at Chul-san's last night.

196
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,032
The alley is pretty narrow,
so I didn't take my car.

197
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,243
And that explains my lousy outfit.

198
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,161
Did you hear what that betrayer said?

199
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,872
I think it's nice and casual.

200
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,833
Until now, you looked so perfect
that it made me uncomfortable.

201
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,170
I'm far from perfect.

202
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,423
What are you doing tomorrow?

203
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,341
Tomorrow?

204
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,093
Nothing much.

205
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,177
-Really?
-Yes.

206
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,721
You have no plans for your birthday?

207
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,058
-My birthday?
-Yes.

208
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,936
His birthday isn't for a while.

209
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,397
I guess it's Mr. Han's.
He wrote those letters.

210
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,526
Oh, it is my birthday tomorrow.
It slipped my mind.

211
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,740
Do you remember writing to me
about your wish?

212
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,159
My wish?

213
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,329
Of course, I do.

214
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,292
I'll make that wish come true tomorrow.

215
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,752
Okay.

216
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,462
Don't make any plans.

217
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,524
-Let's go.
-Okay.

218
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,863
Hey! What are you doing?

219
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,577
Thank you.

220
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,379
What is he thinking?

221
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,715
I approve.

222
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,969
-You're jealous, aren't you?
-Of that?

223
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,472
Don't be stupid. Absolutely not.

224
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,890
Jealousy is…

225
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,061
-for losers.
-Don't cry.

226
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,022
Let's go.

227
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,825
Shouldn't you go back to work?

228
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
I will after I take you home.

229
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,623
Goodness, I'm not a kid.

230
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,255
Your hand…

231
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,799
My hand? What about it?

232
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,473
I thought my hands are pretty big,
but they look tiny next to yours.

233
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,646
Oh…

234
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,177
-Do-san?
-Yes?

235
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,012
Do-san.

236
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,600
Yong-san, did you know I have huge hands?

237
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,311
How can it make me so happy?
I must be crazy.

238
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,687
Don't go crazy now. Come.

239
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,647
-What's wrong?
-Just come.

240
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,357
Hurry.

241
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,527
Line up, please!

242
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,571
-Give me one.
-You'll get one.

243
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,157
Please wait! Whatever, just take them all!

244
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,243
-What's going on?
-The news about CODA is finally out.

245
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,245
Don't worry. You'll get one.

246
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,582
Gosh, why do you show up so late
when you're the CEO?

247
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,959
-He's the CEO?
-The CEO is here!

248
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,461
You won the CODA competition?

249
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,421
-Hello.
-Can we have a meeting, please?

250
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,256
-We'd like a meeting.
-Calm down.

251
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,634
-We're GT Electronics.
-They all want to invest?

252
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,261
This is it. We're going big now.

253
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,931
-Take my business card!
-Thank you.

254
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,641
-Calm down!
-Thank you.

255
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,102
Nice to meet you all.

256
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,144
All right.

257
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,021
Let's get started.

258
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,357
Our company is called Samsan Tech.

259
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,567
Kim Yong-san, Lee Chul-san,
and Nam Do-san.

260
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,070
That's where our name comes from.
Three Sans.

261
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,532
We'd love to hear
about your business model.

262
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,866
Oh, sure.

263
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,618
Just a moment.

264
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,412
Take your time.

265
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,789
CONTENT

266
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,253
When learning image recognition,

267
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,172
there is a trade-off
between network size and accuracy.

268
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,590
-Here, you see--
-I get it.

269
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,428
I see how great your technology is,
but how are you going to make money?

270
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,723
Money?

271
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,573
To raise accuracy,
the quantity has to increase,

272
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,116
making the learning harder.

273
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,743
To solve that, our learning architecture--

274
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,581
So you don't have
a clear revenue model yet?

275
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,924
We'll discuss it and get back to you.

276
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,509
It all sounds brilliant,

277
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,304
but I'm afraid it's not
our main field of interest.

278
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,639
Thanks for the explanation.
I appreciate it.

279
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,653
-There.
-Thank you.

280
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,324
As you can see,
since our network is so slim,

281
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,076
it requires shorter training time
and is easy to implement.

282
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,329
Oh, my. Give them a big hand.

283
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,623
This is amazing.

284
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,418
So it's not reinforcement through
adding feature maps. Is that right?

285
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,794
That's right.

286
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,633
As you can see here,
we connect the feature maps together.

287
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,344
-Can we see the next page?
-Sure. Next page.

288
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,679
Here's the next page.
Take close-ups if you want.

289
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,139
This is worth the wait.

290
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,475
The future of Samsan Tech--

291
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,980
Are you stupid? You want to hand
your technology to them on a plate?

292
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,194
I've never seen you. Where do you work?

293
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,448
Are you sure you're VCs,
not here to steal their technology?

294
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,867
VC: INVESTOR THAT PROVIDES CAPITAL
TO VENTURES

295
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,328
SAMSAN TECH INNOVATIONS

296
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,372
You're developers, aren't you?

297
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,917
What's this photo?

298
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,796
Look, we need to verify their technology
before investing--

299
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,923
Give me back my ID card.

300
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,889
Your business card says you're a VC,

301
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,101
but your ID card says
you lead the deep learning team.

302
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,143
DEEP LEARNING TEAM MANAGER

303
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,648
Which is true?

304
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,701
Let's go, guys.

305
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,327
Okay.

306
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,845
I didn't even like the design of this.
What is this, traffic lights?

307
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,763
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

308
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,100
SAMSAN TECH
ON STANDBY 24/7

309
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,232
Are you naive or stupid?

310
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,484
Were you going to give away
the whole algorithm?

311
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,571
They said they wanted to see
our technology before investing.

312
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,448
You should've found out who they are.

313
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,241
Isn't that common sense?

314
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,662
And what? You want to get into Sand Box?

315
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,788
Dream on.

316
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,083
But we won the CODA competition.

317
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,919
And you saw how many investors
are showing interest.

318
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,089
So what?
Have any of them gotten back to you?

319
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,467
No.

320
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,388
Is your job discouraging people?

321
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,974
Why are you always so critical?

322
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,519
None of the VCs we met today
were harsh like you.

323
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
Because they're going to turn you down!

324
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,485
This isn't the car they're going to ride.
That's why they just compliment it.

325
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:46,114
On the other hand, I want to know
about the tires, the lining. All of it.

326
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,325
Because I might actually ride it.

327
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,827
Because I actually am interested!

328
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,871
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,001
From now on, ask me

330
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,921
before you make any decision.

331
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,425
Understood?

332
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,594
Yes.

333
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,849
We've officially become his underlings.

334
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,645
On that note, let me ask you something.

335
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,230
What is it?

336
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,316
I ran into

337
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,985
Dal-mi earlier.

338
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,031
-In those clothes?
-I told her they're Chul-san's.

339
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,282
Chul-san's?

340
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,909
Okay.

341
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:39,417
I didn't know you could be
so shameless and quick-witted.

342
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,131
Dal-mi said that tomorrow

343
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,258
is my birthday.

344
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,137
It's my birthday tomorrow.
Did I write that in the letters?

345
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,889
Do you remember writing
about your wish, too?

346
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,100
Dal-mi said she'd make my wish come true.

347
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,518
My wish?

348
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,771
-I don't remember it.
-I see.

349
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,609
You don't remember it? Are you serious?

350
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,279
What should Do-san do then?

351
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,573
-What do you mean?
-Exactly.

352
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,910
Do-san is only dealing with
that Dal-mi girl

353
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,204
because you asked him to.

354
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,707
And what's this attitude of yours?

355
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,209
In that case, we can't cooperate.

356
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,753
-Only because I asked him to?
-Yes.

357
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,590
Do-san wants nothing to do with girls.

358
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,301
You could call him a modern-day hermit.

359
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,387
Yes, and now he's going
to all this trouble

360
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,973
just to save Samsan Tech.

361
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:37,851
Is that right?

362
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,021
I didn't realize
you were such an ambitious man.

363
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,195
Well, yes. I am ambitious.

364
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,654
You're ambitious…

365
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,241
I don't know what you owe and to whom…

366
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,370
But I doubt you can pay your debt
without Do-san's help.

367
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,040
And you've got the nerve
to treat us like this?

368
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,959
You're basically making it impossible
for us to cooperate.

369
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,544
I'm making it…

370
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,507
I'm making it impossible?

371
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,768
You're doing a great job.

372
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,814
And I'm thankful.

373
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,611
Please keep up the good work.

374
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,824
Okay.

375
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,286
We've taken the high ground now.

376
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,668
Don't hesitate to ask me anything.

377
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,127
Okay.

378
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,631
Hey, sit comfortably.

379
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,592
You should.
This is your office, after all.

380
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,280
-Grandma!
-Gosh, you startled me.

381
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,116
I'd finally threaded the needle.

382
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,450
I'll do it for you.

383
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,122
Grandma, can I borrow your blanket?

384
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,457
My blanket? Why?

385
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,334
I'm going on a date.

386
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,380
Do-san and I are going
on our first official date tomorrow.

387
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,426
-There you go. I'll put it here.
-Okay.

388
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,012
-Thanks.
-No problem.

389
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,141
Why does she need a blanket, though?

390
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:48,732
Hey. Why do you need a blanket on a date?

391
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,942
It's Do-san's birthday tomorrow.

392
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,527
I'll make his wish come true.

393
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,155
What does a blanket have
to do with his birthday?

394
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,948
Is it just me?

395
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,659
My imagination is running wild.

396
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,495
Your imagination? Like what?

397
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,538
It's absolutely

398
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,915
unspeakable.

399
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,250
What?

400
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,671
Grandma. This is what we're going to do.

401
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,220
Oh…

402
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,514
Come on.

403
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,186
You had me panicking.

404
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,024
That looks good.

405
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,736
There you go. You look amazing.

406
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,237
This fits me perfectly

407
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,323
unlike the previous one,
which was too short.

408
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,951
"Too short"? You're just
a couple of centimeters taller than me.

409
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,496
Really? I'm 187cm tall. What about you?

410
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,706
I bought this one for you.

411
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,666
And these ones here, too.

412
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,460
All of them?

413
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,465
Put on this watch.

414
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,843
This looks really expensive.

415
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,887
-It's more than the car.
-What?

416
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,356
I'm not giving you this.
Use it carefully and return it. Okay?

417
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,108
Be careful.

418
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,277
Be absolutely careful, okay?

419
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,534
I'm curious, Mr. Han.
Why are you going to all this trouble?

420
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,703
Like I said, I'm trying to pay my debt.

421
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,498
How in debt are you

422
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,917
that it can't be paid with your wealth?

423
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,297
I wish it could be paid with money.

424
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,061
-This is the salad fork.
-The salad fork.

425
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,896
-The dessert fork.
-The dessert fork.

426
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,773
-Yes, that's right.
-Okay.

427
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,108
This is how you drink wine.

428
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,402
First, swirl your glass.

429
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,113
No, not so vigorously.

430
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,906
Swirl just slightly.

431
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,200
Now, sniff it.

432
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,540
Not so loudly. Just enjoy the aroma.

433
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,959
-The aroma?
-Slowly.

434
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,839
No, not like that.
There's no need to inhale so deeply.

435
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,174
Do-san is an avatar.

436
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,634
I wonder if he can look like a CEO
by doing that.

437
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,386
Just have a quick sniff.

438
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,848
That's enough. Put down your glass.

439
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,349
That's it. Good.

440
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,267
We don't drink it?

441
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,395
Go over it again.

442
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,398
-Which is the salad fork?
-Now.

443
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,650
I mean, which is the salad fork?

444
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,194
This.

445
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,987
-Now, find the dessert fork.
-Okay.

446
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,617
Have you two never dated either?

447
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,161
It's not because we haven't wanted to.

448
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,413
What does that mean?
Does that mean you tried?

449
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,123
Yes, we sure have.

450
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,375
There are

451
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,629
considerably fewer girls than guys
in the Engineering Department.

452
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,673
Yes, to get more chances to meet girls,

453
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,092
we even started a club.

454
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,260
What kind of club?

455
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,268
There you go. It's done.

456
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,689
CLUB ROOM

457
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,318
We should close the door.
We're not open yet. But soon.

458
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,904
<i>A knitting club.</i>

459
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,447
<i>Knitting?</i>

460
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,574
<i>That's how desperate we were.</i>

461
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,409
<i>But instead of girls…</i>

462
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>Nam Do-san came. To actually knit.</i>

463
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,587
There were, of course, a few girls
who came to join the club now and then.

464
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,339
<i>But there was no point.</i>

465
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>Once a girl asked,
"Do-san, have you always been single?"</i>

466
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,929
<i>And he answered,
"Maybe. But I like to mingle."</i>

467
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,476
He drove the girl away
with his lame jokes.

468
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,564
One day, another girl
almost joined our club.

469
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,358
<i>She said, "Do-san, thanks for letting me
borrow your notes,"</i>

470
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,693
<i>giving him a present.</i>

471
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,320
<i>He said, "I'm the one
who should thank you now."</i>

472
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,989
<i>Everything was going well</i>

473
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,200
<i>until the girl said,
"I'm twice as thankful as you are."</i>

474
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,287
<i>"That means neither of us is thankful.</i>

475
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,956
<i>Let's say your gratitude is A,
and mine is B.</i>

476
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,250
<i>B is larger than A, but A equals 2B.</i>

477
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,753
<i>For that to be true,
both A and B should be negative numbers.</i>

478
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,883
<i>In other words, what we're feeling is
the opposite of gratitude."</i>

479
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,344
That's how he drove that girl away.

480
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,056
Once, a sexy and a bit older girl said,

481
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,350
<i>"I heard you're blood type O.</i>

482
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,353
<i>People with blood type O
tend to be easygoing and honest."</i>

483
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,855
<i>Do-san answered seriously,</i>

484
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,067
<i>"Personalities are determined
by your brain cells." She said, "Yes."</i>

485
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,862
<i>"Blood types are determined
by your red blood cells." "Yes."</i>

486
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,949
<i>"Normally, your brain cells never come
into contact with your red blood cells.</i>

487
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,577
<i>So how could your blood type
affect your personality?</i>

488
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,204
<i>Gosh, this is driving me freaking crazy.</i>

489
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,664
<i>Darn it."</i>

490
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,334
I'm blood type O, too.

491
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,379
Like that, he practically
kicked the girl out.

492
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,216
So what you're saying is,
even though it wasn't intentional…

493
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,302
He ended up driving all the girls away.

494
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,180
And because of him,
we haven't had any girlfriends either.

495
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,183
Now that I think of it,
we're that punk's victims.

496
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,976
Did you say this is the salad fork?

497
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,437
-No! The dessert fork!
-The dessert fork!

498
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,109
-Gosh.
-Seriously.

499
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,661
-See you later, Grandma.
-Dal-mi.

500
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,829
Take this.

501
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,917
-What is this?
-A birthday present.

502
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,296
Tell him it's from me to the Nam Do-san
in the old days. He'll understand.

503
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,174
-"The Nam Do-san in the old days"?
-Yes.

504
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,218
Okay.

505
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,845
-See you, ma'am.
-See you, young lady.

506
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,598
-See you.
-Bye.

507
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,569
Be natural.
Don't cross your legs or anything.

508
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,199
<i>What was that noise? What just happened?</i>

509
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,327
<i>Don't try to look cool, okay?</i>

510
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,830
Okay.

511
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,624
You still don't remember your wish?

512
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:26,004
Well, I'm sure it's some kind of present.
Don't forget to thank her.

513
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,102
-What's that?
-It's a present from my grandma

514
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,187
to the Nam Do-san in the old days.

515
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,108
The Nam Do-san in the old days? That's me.

516
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,987
Where are we going?
To your home? Your office?

517
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,989
-My home?
-Your office?

518
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,200
We should go somewhere inside
to play Go-Stop.

519
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,618
-Go-Stop?
<i>-Go-Stop?</i>

520
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,496
You said your wish was to play Go-Stop.

521
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,332
-I did?
-Why?

522
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,710
That's what I should be asking.
Why Go-Stop?

523
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,255
I have no idea. I wonder why.

524
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,424
I don't remember it.

525
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,343
You might remember it
once we start playing.

526
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,887
Oh, call your friends over, too.

527
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,389
-You wanted to play with many people.
-My friends?

528
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,895
So where are we going?
Your home? Your office?

529
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,689
Well… Let me get that.

530
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,654
Let's go to my office.

531
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,990
Your office? Which one?

532
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,366
Hello? Which one?

533
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,119
-The one by the Han River, remember?
-Yes.

534
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,122
-Let's go there.
-Sure.

535
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,291
We're going to the one by the Han River.

536
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,627
By the Han River?

537
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,962
Here?

538
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,302
Hello? Did he hang up? Hello?

539
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,806
I don't have the phone number
of Samsan Tech.

540
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,939
Hurry up.

541
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,316
-To the right.
-To the right.

542
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,277
We don't have much time.

543
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,821
-Don't get angry.
-Help me.

544
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,490
Can't you do it alone?
You obviously can't. There you go.

545
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,409
-Hurry up and come here.
-I'm coming.

546
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,495
-Take this.
-Give it to me.

547
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,205
-One,
-No.

548
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,623
two, three.

549
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,126
-Put this away first.
-Isn't that a good photo?

550
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,127
-It is.
-Okay.

551
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,130
Wait, that's not how you do it.

552
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,593
-This feels like our office now.
-I agree.

553
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,012
-Does this go here?
-Yes.

554
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,557
-The one above that.
-What?

555
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,017
I don't think this is the right one.

556
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,352
It's just that you're bad.

557
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,147
You're taking a whole day.

558
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,149
I'm almost done. Give me just a second.

559
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,526
I'm done. Should we turn on the monitor?

560
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,653
Please don't touch it. You might break it.

561
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,948
You should get changed, too.

562
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,742
What do you think?

563
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,953
-It's perfect. Good job.
-I picked navy.

564
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,330
They're almost here.
Hurry up and get changed.

565
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,915
Hurry. But don't drop anything.

566
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,418
-I'll be cleaning up over there.
-Okay.

567
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,879
Hurry up.

568
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,130
Gosh.

569
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,178
-Welcome.
-Hello.

570
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,888
-Hi.
-Hi.

571
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,850
It's your first date.
Why the hell did you come here?

572
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,895
The weather is lovely.
You could've enjoyed the sun somewhere.

573
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,148
Mr. Han, we meet again.

574
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,191
Hi.

575
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,776
I'm really interested in their company.

576
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,404
I come here often.
As if it were my own office.

577
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,697
I see.

578
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,451
-That's a perfect spot.
-Where?

579
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,870
Do you all know how to play Go-Stop?

580
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,205
Go-Stop?

581
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,791
Do you remember why you wanted to play?

582
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,502
No. It's been too long. I forgot.

583
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,964
Anyway, try to relax. Be natural.
Put on a little smile.

584
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,759
Oh, my. What is all this?

585
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,053
It's a feast.

586
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,512
<i>Songpyeon</i>?

587
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,307
Why <i>songpyeon</i> on a birthday,
not <i>sirutteok</i>?

588
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,850
-Ta-da.
-Oh, my!

589
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,395
Unbelievable. She made so much.

590
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,107
<i>Do-san.</i>

591
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,779
<i>My dad says praying on the full moon
on Chuseok makes your wish come true.</i>

592
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,740
<i>Do you have any wishes?</i>

593
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,992
My wish…

594
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,703
<i>-Four generations of family members
</i>-My wish…

595
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,080
<i>are gathered together.</i>

596
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,083
<i>The whole family played traditional games</i>

597
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,878
<i>they'd never played before such as
spinning tops and</i> neolttwigi.

598
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,715
<i>Families that stayed indoors
spent the day playing games</i>

599
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,135
<i>such as Go-stop and</i> Yut Nori.

600
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,762
TO DAL-MI
MY WISH IS…

601
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:49,809
<i>This Chuseok, the whole family gathered</i>
<i>for the first time in a long time…</i>

602
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,062
MY WISH IS TO PLAY GO-STOP
WITH MY WHOLE FAMILY

603
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,483
-But I don't see any <i>galbi</i>.
-This is enough.

604
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,485
I'm just joking!

605
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,155
-Laugh harder.
-It's okay if it's cold.

606
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,825
The microwave is over there… Right?

607
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,076
Yes, that's right.

608
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,832
Here we go.

609
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,001
Let's begin.

610
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,086
Hurry up.

611
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,879
Isn't it such a weird wish, though?

612
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,049
I know. Why would playing Go-Stop
be anyone's wish?

613
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,886
You play Go-Stop on holidays every year.
Right, Mr. Han?

614
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,764
Well, I'm…

615
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,600
To someone,
it might have a special meaning.

616
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,687
What's ordinary to one person
can be extraordinary to another.

617
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,648
He probably has fond memories of it.

618
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:42,570
Maybe he really enjoyed playing it
with his family on the holidays.

619
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,490
Or maybe it wasn't ordinary at all to him
and made him envious.

620
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,035
-Right?
-Right.

621
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,746
-What?
-What?

622
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,080
-What?
-What?

623
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,876
I can relate.

624
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,961
I've been there.

625
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,713
Oh, really?

626
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,550
Let's get started now.

627
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,094
-Hurry up.
-Come on.

628
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,138
-Let's get started.
-Okay.

629
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,057
-Here you go.
-Well…

630
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,975
-Let me see.
-Here.

631
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,102
Gosh, I'm screwed.

632
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,820
Stop! Do-san has five <i>gwangs</i>.

633
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,200
Do I win five points then?

634
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,118
No, you win 15 points.

635
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,080
Yong-san and Mr. Han have no <i>gwangs</i>.

636
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,248
You're not allowed to help him.

637
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,042
-It's against the rules.
-Be quiet!

638
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,752
-How much is it then?
-3,000 won.

639
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,170
-It's 3,000 won.
-3,000 won.

640
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,047
You're supposed to learn by losing.

641
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,633
-You shouldn't help him.
-Give me that.

642
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,560
Here we go.

643
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,647
Oh, my goodness.

644
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,695
What's useless to you is valuable to me
now. Yes! It's all mine. Give it to me.

645
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,114
Give it to me!

646
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,532
Stop what you're doing.

647
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,953
I pulled another matching card.
The tables have turned, Chul-san.

648
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,290
I win, Chul-san!

649
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,385
Hurry and pay up.

650
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,928
So who wins?

651
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,945
What was this called? This is a sweep!

652
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,948
You guys have to give me one
of your <i>pi</i> cards.

653
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,241
Give me a <i>pi</i> card.

654
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,743
Don't throw the cards like that. God…

655
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,789
Seriously.

656
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,458
Do you like eating crumbs?

657
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,877
I'm not eating this. It's plastic.

658
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,966
You guys think that's funny?
It's not funny, Mr. Nam.

659
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,093
What are you talking about?
It's hilarious.

660
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,305
Mr. Han, just let it go.

661
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,056
Is your blood type A?

662
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,611
It shows from the way you play Go-Stop.

663
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,362
You're definitely blood type A.

664
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,864
-Right?
-What?

665
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,664
Clearly, considering how timid
and unforgiving he is.

666
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,750
-Unbelievable.
-See?

667
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,754
Do-san, you're putting aside
your beliefs for a girl?

668
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,922
Dal-mi, the thing is…

669
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,383
He doesn't believe
in blood type personalities.

670
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,593
Really? You don't?

671
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,178
I do.

672
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,681
Galileo Galilei must have felt this way
when he denied heliocentrism.

673
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,309
Exactly. Still, the Earth
revolves around the Sun.

674
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,894
No, I really believe it.

675
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,647
-I can't believe you.
-I'm sweating.

676
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,107
-You punk.
-I am blood type A.

677
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,361
You are? I knew it.

678
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,667
Please thank your grandma for me.

679
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,631
Why don't you thank her yourself?

680
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,341
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

681
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,802
<i>I've never met her.</i>

682
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,888
No. I'll visit her properly
some other time.

683
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,100
All right. I had so much fun today.

684
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,310
Me, too.

685
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,436
Bye.

686
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,651
Wait, Dal-mi.

687
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,320
Yes?

688
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,534
What do you like about me?

689
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,452
What?

690
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,038
Why all of a sudden?

691
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,091
Please tell me what you like about me.

692
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,721
First of all,

693
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,766
you're my first love.

694
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,686
<i>That's not me.</i>

695
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:28,939
And?

696
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,319
Your letters

697
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,614
comforted me for a long time.

698
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,158
<i>That's not me either.</i>

699
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,368
And?

700
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,413
And…

701
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,375
after all these years,
you're still so brilliant and cool.

702
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,210
<i>Again,</i>

703
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,796
<i>that's not me.</i>

704
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,048
And?

705
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,174
You want to hear more?

706
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,350
You have nice, big hands.

707
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,864
My hands?

708
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,496
Why are you suddenly asking this?
You're embarrassing me.

709
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,707
I'm sorry. That was random.

710
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,627
Go inside. I'll get going.

711
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,505
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

712
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,323
YOU PASSED THE 1ST SCREENING
AND ARE QUALIFIED FOR THE HACKATHON

713
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,200
Oh, my God!

714
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,910
Dal-mi, is that you?

715
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,787
YOU PASSED THE 1ST SCREENING

716
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,706
Yes, I'm home.

717
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
Yes!

718
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:29,411
YOU PASSED THE 1ST SCREENING
AND ARE QUALIFIED FOR THE HACKATHON

719
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,454
YOU PASSED THE 1ST SCREENING

720
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,001
Have some coffee.

721
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,045
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

722
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,217
<i>Ms. Choi.</i>

723
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,595
Is Dal-mi home yet?

724
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,015
<i>Yes. She was in such a good mood
that she danced in the entrance.</i>

725
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,516
Really?

726
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,102
Thank you, Good Boy.

727
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:21,023
Why do you keep thanking me?
I haven't done anything much.

728
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,485
Also, why did you send so much food?

729
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,446
It's the least I can do.

730
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,701
Thanks to you,
Dal-mi's confidence is soaring.

731
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,542
Isn't that a good thing? Why do you sigh?

732
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,919
I'm worried she'll fall

733
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,963
and get hurt.

734
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,096
She won't get hurt.

735
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,184
I'll make sure

736
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,645
she doesn't.

CEO SEO CHEONG-MYEONG

741
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,795
DADDY, PLEASE ORDER A BUFFET
ON MY BIRTHDAY

742
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,816
You did a good job today.

743
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,318
-Here.
-Oh, yes.

744
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,406
The suits are here.

745
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,742
Take them with you. You can have them.

746
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,410
No. I'll buy my own clothes.

747
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,578
Come on.

748
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,789
-Your sense of style--
-I know.

749
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,209
It's awful.

750
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,630
But I'll change.

751
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,595
-Why suddenly draw the line?
-I'm respecting the line.

752
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,264
If I take them, it's not an investment.

753
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,224
It's charity.

754
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,645
Just give me some tips

755
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,148
whether it's on my style or business.

756
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,026
I'll follow them no matter what.

757
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,288
-No matter what?
-Yes.

758
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,503
What if I tell you to recruit a CEO
for your company?

759
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,505
Pardon?

760
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:34,966
That's my tip.

761
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,135
Give up your CEO position.

762
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,180
You're not cut out to be a CEO.

763
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,098
You'll only make everyone's life harder.

764
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,476
Once you enter Sand Box,
recruit a CEO first.

765
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,855
What your company needs is a proper CEO.

766
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,276
Are you saying
I'll never become a good CEO?

767
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,403
Yes.

768
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,022
Hey, what are you doing here?

769
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,276
Wonders never cease!

770
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,278
I have a desperate wish.

771
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,529
Lord is busy.

772
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,533
He has no time to listen to the prayer
of an unfaithful believer like you.

773
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,742
Lord,

774
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,787
listen to the prayers
of unfaithful believers

775
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,873
in order to make them faithful.

776
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,044
That's what we call business
and marketing.

777
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,005
Cut the crap.

778
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,632
What is this desperate wish
of yours, anyway?

779
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,677
And what's that luggage?

780
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,222
Sister, shouldn't you keep it down
in the church?

781
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,829
What's that luggage?
Are you running away from home?

782
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,831
Father, Mother.

783
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,336
I passed the first screening of Sand Box.

784
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,591
I don't even get excited anymore.

785
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,093
You tell us you passed this and that
all the time,

786
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,179
but nothing ever changes.

787
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,642
If you passed the first screening,
what's the next step?

788
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,895
The next step will be
a competition called a hackathon.

789
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,190
Each team is given three days
to come up with a business model.

790
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,485
You have to win the competition
to enter Sand Box.

791
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,819
At Sand Box,

792
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,239
you're given an office,
and they even pay your employees.

793
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,241
Besides, investors will--

794
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,078
Whatever.
Just tell us when you actually get in.

795
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,956
I've had enough of your empty promises.

796
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:14,960
Okay.

797
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,011
-See you.
-See you.

798
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,694
That rude brat.

799
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,113
Did you see how he just slammed the door?

800
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,574
He's rebelling against me, isn't he?

801
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,451
If I were him, I'd smash that door.

802
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,579
Is it so hard to wish him good luck?

803
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,124
Why did you have to put him down
like that?

804
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,378
I said that as his parent.
Can't I say that much?

805
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,506
It hurts even more
because it's from his parent!

806
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,553
Well, Father.

807
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,513
It was

808
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,640
the wind.

809
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,100
What?

810
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,310
It's very windy outside.

811
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,312
I didn't mean to slam the door.

812
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,399
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

813
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,526
I'll get going.

814
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,696
Do-san. Good luck!

815
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,699
Thanks.

816
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,868
See you.

817
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,839
Gosh, that startled me.

818
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,717
This wasn't the wind.

819
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,080
SAND BOX IS ROOTING FOR YOUR DREAMS

820
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,248
You're here.

821
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:18,917
Here.

822
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,962
Are the developers running late?

823
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,508
Well… They called this morning,
and they're backing out.

824
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,592
Why?

825
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,677
The lead developer is having a baby soon.

826
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,888
Su-jin is getting married soon, too.

827
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,724
They say they don't want to take the risk.

828
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,392
Well, what can we do?

829
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,270
We have no developers now.
Will it be okay?

830
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,066
Let's go.
We'll see if we can recruit some here.

831
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,076
In-jae?

832
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,037
No way, she's in the US.

833
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,048
That's what the autographed ball said.

834
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,475
That's what the baseball said.

835
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,065
The problem is, there are too many
following their dreams.

836
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,609
I know.
I hope I don't get crushed to death.

837
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,529
And they've already been screened once?

838
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,990
-Stop it.
-No, I won't.

839
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,908
Stop it.

840
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,123
Excuse me. Coming through.

841
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,108
Relax.

842
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,902
I'm extremely nervous.

843
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,654
-Why? You're a man.
-Aren't you nervous?

844
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,369
It's starting.

845
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,472
The 12th Sand Box residency program
applicants, welcome.

846
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,891
I'm Yoon Seon-hak,
the director of Sand Box.

847
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,565
Sand Box was started

848
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:51,903
by successful entrepreneurs
to help fledgling entrepreneurs

849
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:56,866
and became Asia's largest
start-up accelerating center.

850
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,745
ACCELERATING CENTER: ORGANIZATION THAT
INVESTS IN AND TRAINS START-UPS

851
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,998
Let me compare start-ups to cars.

852
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:09,671
For one reason or another, the cars you're
in right now aren't moving forward.

853
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,799
Some of you may have
just jumped in brand-new cars.

854
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,718
Some of you may be sitting
in broken-down cars

855
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,096
that won't start.

856
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,890
And some of you
may have just switched cars.

857
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:25,061
To make a car move,
you step on the accelerator, right?

858
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,104
-Yes!
-Yes!

859
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:29,774
Sand Box was created to be

860
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,150
your accelerator.

861
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,911
What is he doing here?

862
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,456
Now, the first step

863
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,709
-is to form teams.
-Is he someone you know?

864
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,754
Some of you have already found
everyone you need,

865
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,756
but not all of you have.

866
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,592
Some people even came alone.

867
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,803
The right to choose teammates

868
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:02,890
is given to the CEO,
the person whose job is to steer the car.

869
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,353
Out of the 400 people here,

870
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,940
only 40 get to become CEOs.

871
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,778
Only 40?

872
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,324
Each team can have up to five members

873
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,035
and will compete in a three-day hackathon.

874
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:27,832
The five teams chosen by the investors
in the hackathon

875
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,084
will be accepted into Sand Box.

876
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,799
That's tough.

877
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,720
We're one. We'll stick together
whether we win or fail, okay?

878
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,514
-You bet. Needless to say.
-Hands in, guys.

879
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,641
One, two, three.

880
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,225
-Do-san…
-Chul-san…

881
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,560
Forget it.

882
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,811
Gosh.

01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:55,151

HACKATHON LIVE BROADCAST

885
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,869
<i>The whole process is being broadcast live
on the Sand Box app.</i>

886
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:10,291
<i>I know your backgrounds range
from management to accounting,</i>

887
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,710
<i>development, and design.</i>

888
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,339
<i>But none of your backgrounds
or credentials</i>

889
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,967
<i>matter in the CEO selection process.</i>

890
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,179
They don't matter?

891
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,600
Now you're talking.

892
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,852
Is that good or bad for us?

893
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,647
-It's good…
-It's bad…

894
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,649
-It's good.
-It's good.

895
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,777
Now, we'll send you 50 words

896
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,029
start-ups are paying attention to.

897
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,823
Words? What words?

898
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,200
Are you receiving texts?

899
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,744
Within 30 seconds,

900
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:51,791
send in five start-up keywords
that are most relevant to each word.

901
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,418
What?

902
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,545
My phone is dead, though.

903
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:59,048
The people who get
the most relevant keywords right

904
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,092
will be chosen as CEOs.

905
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,348
So they want those who know
how to read trends to be CEOs.

906
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,434
That makes sense.

907
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,103
Okay. Let's start.

908
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,483
FINE DUST

909
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,028
Fine dust…

910
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,447
ULTRAFINE PARTICLES

911
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,574
-What?
-Masks.

912
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,617
What do I do? My phone is dead.

913
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,994
My phone is dead.

914
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:36,961
OLD DIESEL CARS, YELLOW DUST

915
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:41,841
Why didn't they tell us beforehand?
I'm sure I'm not the only one.

916
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:44,635
OLD DIESEL CARS

917
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,595
FINE DUST

918
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,804
KEYWORDS HAVE BEEN SENT

919
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,558
ULTRAFINE PARTICLES,
MASKS, EMERGENCY ALERTS

920
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,020
-Yes!
-Masks…

921
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,857
Focus.

922
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,735
SECURITY

923
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,365
That seems hectic. And you don't have
enough time to search the Internet.

924
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,660
It'd be hard even for those
with an insight into trends.

925
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,498
-Wait.
-What?

926
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,834
No. I must be seeing things.

927
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,090
I'm going to start a company,
like you did.

928
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,843
No way.

Gosh, what was it?

937
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,656
Will I be sent home like this?

938
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,990
WINTER OLYMPICS

939
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,577

01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,870

01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,376
I'm not there. You?

968
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,588
Me neither.

969
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:30,051
These are the 40 CEOs
who can choose their teammates.

970
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,011
Please come up on stage!

971
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,765
Then we can't be on the same team?

972
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,475
This is ridiculous.

973
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:40,227
What an absurd way to choose CEOs!

974
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,104
They should've made us code instead.

975
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,231
Then no one could beat Do-san.

Are you saying
I'll never become a good CEO?

979
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:53,991
Yes.

980
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,498
What is that girl doing there?

981
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,897
That crook?

982
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,203
Isn't that Won In-jae?

983
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:40,705
Yes.

984
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,291
What do we do now?

985
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,293
What do we do?

986
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,130
What?

987
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:52,049
This period will be tough.

988
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,386
Isn't that Won In-jae,
the CEO of Nature Morning?

989
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,471
Why would she want to enter Sand Box?

990
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,057
She'd be like a college student
at a kindergarten.

991
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,894
Excuse me. Can you come back later?

Lord.

01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:25,499
I'm curious to know
what my hotshot sister is doing here

996
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,002
instead of going back to the US.

997
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,172
I'm curious to know

998
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,217
what your hotshot boyfriend is doing here.

999
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,552
What?

1000
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,645
What? Do-san?

1001
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,742
I'll give you all one hour.

1002
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:05,164
The CEOs on stage will choose
their teammates for the hackathon.

1003
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,667
I hope you will choose them wisely.

1004
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,524
This person has a nice background.

1005
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,734
-What do we do?
-This person…

1006
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,825
We're looking for more people.

1007
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,661
Oh, so that's your field.

1008
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,413
-Are you interested?
-Do you have a team?

1009
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,833
I don't have a team yet.

1010
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,751
Right. I think so, too.

1011
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,796
How long did you work as a developer?

1012
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:03,806
Do-san.

1013
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,060
Why are you here?

1014
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,521
You have a fancy office.

1015
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,149
And you already found an investor.

1016
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,609
You're in a Pre-Series A round.

1017
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,865
I'm wondering that, too.

1018
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:22,992
What is Nam Do-san doing here?

1019
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,041
Here it says you haven't found
any investors yet.

1020
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,211
And your only credential is
winning the CODA competition.

1021
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,097
I'm sorry

1022
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,142
I deceived you, Dal-mi.

1023
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:54,565
You both look so shocked.

1024
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:58,319
Shocked to be fooled,
and shocked to be caught.

1025
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,621
Are you saying

1026
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,291
you don't even have a shot

1027
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,835
at entering Sand Box
if no CEO chooses you?

1028
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,423
It's all over now.

1029
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,342
He and Seo Dal-mi are through.

1030
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,308
What a peculiar response to my prayer.

1031
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:33,771
A response?

1032
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:38,901
<i>Lord.</i>

1033
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:44,657
<i>I decided to work up my courage
and start my own business.</i>

1034
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,535
<i>I do have a destination,</i>

1035
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,748
<i>but the path is steep and rough.</i>

1036
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,794
<i>So I'm not sure if I can handle it.</i>

1037
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,715
<i>Please give me the strength to complete</i>

1038
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,801
<i>this long, difficult journey.</i>

1039
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:06,887
<i>And please</i>

1040
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:11,642
<i>lead me to find a companion
for the journey.</i>

1041
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,231
You must be disappointed.

1042
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:18,899
No.

1043
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:22,945
I'm thankful.

1044
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,368
I'm also thankful
for the chance to be a CEO.

1045
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,126
Do-san.

1046
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,797
Will you recruit me
as the CEO of Samsan Tech?

1047
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,885
-What?
-It's not over?

1048
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,894
Is that what you want?
I'd like to make you a similar offer.

1049
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,524
My team happens to be missing developers
at the moment.

1050
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:03,319
And I'd like to recruit you guys.
What do you say?

1051
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:06,572
What?

1052
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,199
I see your credentials are lacking.

1053
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,412
If your CEO also lacks credentials,
won't it be bad for everyone?

1054
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:18,876
Who do you choose, me or Seo Dal-mi?

1055
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:25,966
Do-san.

1056
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,649
-Excuse us for a minute.
-Sorry.

1057
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,578
Do-san, the future of our company
is on the line.

1058
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:57,039
Yes, and it's an amateur
versus a professional.

1059
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,540
Put your feelings aside

1060
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,793
and make a rational decision, okay?

1061
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,755
My choice is the same either way.

1062
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:05,881
It's the same?

1063
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:08,550
Whether you follow your heart or head?

1064
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,386
How is that possible?

1065
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,805
You guys don't want to be
someone's underlings.

1066
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,431
-Of course not.
-Neither do I.

1067
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,682
And?

1068
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:20,813
Dal-mi asked us to recruit her
while Won In-jae said she'd recruit us.

1069
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,650
See the difference?

1070
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:29,029
-Oh…
-Oh…

1071
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,197
There is a difference.

1072
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,617
Either we recruit the CEO
or the CEO recruits us, is that it?

1073
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:37,454
Who do you choose? I'll do as you say.

1074
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:46,797
He even put on such a show. He must have
wanted to show off in front of you.

1075
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,260
Aren't you angry?

1076
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,054
I'm not.

1077
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,891
I've felt the urge to show off
in front of someone many times.

1078
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,351
Will you be the CEO of Samsan Tech?

1079
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:05,751
Gladly.

1080
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,607
-Yes! I win!
-Gosh.

1081
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,527
Five for <i>godori</i>, three for <i>gwang</i>,
and two for <i>pi</i>, so ten in total.

1082
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,321
And penalties for Mr. Han and Dal-mi.

1083
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:01,241
Also, pay Do-san and I for the <i>gwang</i>.

1084
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:02,826
Come on! Pay up.

1085
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:05,329
Gosh, you guys are professionals.

1086
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:07,497
-I guess it's our lucky day.
-Totally.

1087
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,875
<i>Here's your fortune for today.</i>

1088
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,627
-Who is it?
-What's that sound?

1089
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,504
It's Yeong-sil, a speaker
that only gives irrelevant answers.

1090
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,967
It tells you the same fortune every day.
Is that right, Mr. Nam?

1091
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,719
-Yes.
-Every single day.

1092
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,054
The same thing every day.

1093
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,389
<i>Today, the god of fate</i>

1094
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,768
<i>will send a gentle breeze
into your peaceful life.</i>

1095
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,650
It's the same thing every day.

1096
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,819
-It's incredible.
-That's enough, Yeong-sun!

1097
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,451
APPLICANT NUMBER 118
COMPANY NAME: ZEST LINE

1098
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:45,911
REASON FOR APPLICATION

1099
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,417
I REMEMBER SWINGING OVER THE SAND

1100
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,508
I REMEMBER SWINGING OVER THE SAND

1101
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,718
MY DAD SPREAD FOR ME

1102
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:08,642
I wish I could at least fall
on sand instead of concrete.

1103
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,519
Sand?

1104
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,576
WON IN-JAE

1105
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,120
<i>You may run into someone</i>

1106
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,750
<i>you met briefly in the past,
at an unexpected place.</i>

1107
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,673
<i>Be careful.</i>

1108
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:44,428
<i>The person may seem
like a spring breeze at first</i>

1109
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:49,099
<i>but may turn into a strong winter wind</i>

1110
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:54,521
<i>and change your life completely.</i>

1111
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,289
<i>In the limited time,</i>

1112
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:15,876
<i>can you come up with a
practical business idea or not.</i>

1113
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:19,212
<i>Do you really think we should let
a high school graduate become the CEO?</i>

1114
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,340
<i>Do you have regrets? Dal-mi could've
gone to college instead of me.</i>

1115
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,801
<i>You always make the wrong choices.</i>

1116
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,763
I started this because
I wanted to win against In-jae,

1117
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,473
<i>but I keep getting greedy.</i>

1118
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:32,517
I keep wanting more.

1119
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:34,770
How much did Dal-mi find out?

1120
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,313
Mr. Han, wait.

1121
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:39,566
<i>Why did you go to great lengths to
help us even if it meant you had to lie?</i>

1122
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:44,654
